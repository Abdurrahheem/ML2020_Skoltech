    "To solve this task, you will write some code to try random **recurrent neural networks** in action. This part of the assignment is a simple practice with pytorch.\n",
    "* You are **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to read relevant documentation, e.g. for [python](https://docs.python.org/3/), [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/), [matlpotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [pytorch](http://pytorch.org). Also remember that seminars, lecture slides, [Google](http://google.com) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are your close friends during this course (and, probably, whole life?).\n",

    "During the seminar, we worked on building an intution for RNNs. We saw that they are very powerful techniques and compared to ARMA methods, where some assumptions must hold to apply the model, RNNs can be applied on sequential data as blackboxes and lead to good results.\n",

    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ one by one. Through the hidden layer activations, they can \"remember\" some information.

    "Let's discuss this implementation more in detail.\n",
    "## Inputs and outputs of a RNN\n",
    "We start with the two input vectors of the RNN, the input vector and the hidden state.\n",
    "### Input $x$\n",
    "The number of units is represented as $n_x$. It can be understood as the number of units in a single timestep of a single training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A timestep in a single input example is represented as $x^{(i) \\langle t \\rangle }$. The timesteps are indexed as $t$. Normally, a single training example $x^{(i)}$ will consist of multiple time steps $T_x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training examples are grouped into so-called mini batches $x$ of size $m$. Thus, the shape of a mini batch is $(n_x,m,T_x)$. $x$ is thus a 3-dimension tensor and this will be our input into the RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will be working with mini-batches of training examples, we will need a 2D slide $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ of the same shape of our mini batch, $(n_x, m)$. In our implementation, this will be the variable `xt`.\n",
    "### Hidden State $a$\n",
    "The second input required in a RNN is the hidden state $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, an activation function. The hidden state is passed from one step to the next. It shares similarities with our input vector $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it has a length $n_{a}$, and if we include a mini-batch of size $m$, the shape of the mini-batch will be $(n_{a},m)$. The hidden state also makes use of the same index $t$ to iterate and on each loop it uses a 2D slice $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ of shape $(n_{a}, m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, we will have two variables for the hidden state. They will be called `a_prev` and `a_next`.\n",
    "Similarly, on each step, we produce an output vector.\n",
    "### Output $\\hat{y}$\n",
    "The ouput $\\hat{y}$ is also a 3D tensor. Its shape is $(n_{y}, m, T_{y})$, where $n_{y}$ represents the number of units in the vector representing the prediction. As it is the case with the input, $m$ reflects the number of examples in the mini batch and $T_{y}$ the number of steps in the prediction. In our implementation, we will be defining this variable as `y_pred`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we go more in depth and look at a single time step $t$, we have a 2D slice $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ with shape $(n_{y}, m)$. Similarly, the variable in our code for this 2D slice will be called `yt_pred`.\n",
    "## The RNN cell\n",
    "In the animation above, we see that the RNN model consists basically of looping over a single cell over the index $t$. As we outlined above, we take the input consisting of two vectors, the current input $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, and the previous hidden state $a^{\\langle t - 1\\rangle}$. \n",
    "At the same time, we will be passing to the next RNN cell two outputs. They are the hidden state  $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ and the prediction $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",
    "Let's start by implementing the RNN cell!\n",
    "## Task 1. Simple Cell (4 points)\n",
    "In this task, you will have 4 individual exercises:\n",
    "* **(1 pt.)** First, start by implementing the hidden state $a$ with the tanh activation function. It is defined as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "a^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\tanh(W_{aa} a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle} + W_{ax} x^{\\langle t \\rangle} + b_a).\n",

    "* **(1 pt.)** Fourth return `accumulator` and $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ , $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",
    "The function to implement consists of the following arguments:\n",
    "* `xt` - This is the input data at timestep $t$, a pytorch tensor of shape $(n_x, m)$\n",
    "* `a_prev` - Hidden state at timestep \"t-1\", a pytorch tensor of shape $(n_a, m)$\n",

    "## The RNN Forward Pass\n",

    "The family of ARMA processses (such as ARIMA and SARIMA) plays a major role in times series forecasting. In the first half of the homework, we will look deeper into understanding important elements around ARMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by remembering that for a time series $\\{X_t\\}$ with $E(X^2_t) < \\infty$, its mean function is defined by $\\mu_X(t) = E(X_t)$ and the sample mean, for the $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ observations by $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^n_{t=1} x_t$. \n",

    "= E[(X_r - \\mu_X(r))(X_s - \\mu_X(s))]\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "for all integers $r$ and $s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that for $\\{X_t\\}$ to be (weakly) stationary, it must fulfill two conditions. First, $\\mu_X(t)$ must be independent of $t$, and $\\gamma_X(t+h, t)$ must be also independent of $t$ for each h.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the seminar, we applied the autocovariance and the autocorrelation functions to a dataset without deeper discussing their definition. Now, we look deeper into them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocovariance function\n",
    "The autocovariance function or ACVF of $\\{X_t\\}$ at lag $h$ is $\\gamma X(h) = Cov(X_{t+h}, X_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the observations $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$, the sample autocovariance function can be similarly defined by\n",

    "$$ \n",
    "for $-n < h < n$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocorrelation function\n",
    "The autocorrelation function or ACF makes use of ACVF as following $\\rho_X(h) = \\frac{\\gamma X(h)}{\\gamma X(0)} = Cor(X_{t+h}, X_t)$.\n",
